                <h3>Is there an "official" Mardi Gras?</h3>

                <p>
                No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do not believe the claims of
                businesses that offer "official" Mardi Gras merchandise or an "official" Mardi Gras website. Using the term “official”
                is just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know better. Products or websites are
                not licensed by the government for Mardi Gras. Each individual parade krewe is responsible for all of its merchandise.
                In some parts of the country, official organizations control their Mardi Gras celebration, but this is not true in New
                Orleans.

                <h3>When does Mardi Gras start and end?</h3>

            <div class="answer bg-yellow">
                <p>
                The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the Epiphany). Mardi Gras day (Fat Tuesday),
                however, is on a different day each year.
                
                Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each year. Fat Tuesday is always the
                day before Ash Wednesday.
                
                Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay through Ash Wednesday. Check
                out our dates page to see when Fat Tuesday will fall through the next few years.

            <div class="question">
                <h3>What is the weather usually like during Mardi Gras? What should I pack?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer bg-purple">
                <p>
                The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot. Sometimes it will change from one
                extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a chilly morning may turn into a
                warm afternoon.
                
                Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that can get somewhat dirty. Don’t
                forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely want to bring a raincoat!

            <div class="question">
                <h3>Where can I book a room with a balcony to watch the parades go by?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer bg-green">
                <p>
                The best option is to reserve a package in the French Quarter or along the parade route that offers a balcony, food and
                a bathroom pass.

            <div class="answer bg-yellow">
                <p>
                    It's free! Not only that, but you'll leave with bags of Mardi Gras beads and throws. That's why we call it the "Greatest
                    Free Show on Earth!"

            <div class="question">
                <h3>I only have limited time. What is the prime time to visit during Mardi Gras?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer bg-purple">
                <p>
                    The weekend before Fat Tuesday is the prime time to visit New Orleans for Mardi Gras. This is the weekend when Bacchus
                    and Endymion, two of the biggest parades of the season, roll down the streets of New Orleans. The streets are packed all
                    day Saturday and Sunday with parade watchers. If you can stay longer than a weekend, Monday (Lundi Gras) and Fat Tuesday
                    are also great days to experience Mardi Gras. Orpheus, another big parade, rolls on that Monday night, and the Zulu
                    Lundi Gras festival goes on all day. On Fat Tuesday, walking around the French Quarter and seeing all of the costumes
                    and masks is a unique and thrilling experience.

            <div class="question">
                <h3>What happens if there is bad weather?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer bg-green">
                <p>
                The parades roll in light rain. The officials will only postpone if the weather is predicted to be severe. The local TV
                and radio news stations (such as WWL Radio) broadcast the hour-by-hour updates.
