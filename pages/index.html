                        <p>
                        Mardi Gras is a celebration with deep roots that date back to medieval Europe. The festival was first introduced to the
                        United States by French settlers in the late 17th century, and it quickly became a beloved tradition. The earliest Mardi
                        Gras parades in the US were simple processions through the streets, with participants donning masks and costumes.
                        <br><br>
                        Over time, the festival grew in popularity and became more elaborate. In New Orleans, the first organized Mardi Gras
                        parade was held in 1837, with floats, marching bands, and a crowd of enthusiastic spectators. By the late 19th century,
                        Mardi Gras had become a grand spectacle, with ornate floats, themed parades, and thousands of revelers taking to the
                        streets.
                        <br><br>
                        In the early 20th century, Mardi Gras celebrations were threatened by a series of legal challenges and social unrest.
                        However, the festival continued to evolve, and in the 1950s and 60s, it underwent a renaissance. The advent of
                        television brought Mardi Gras to a wider audience, and the festival became a major tourist attraction.
                        <br><br>
                        Today, Mardi Gras remains an important part of New Orleans' cultural heritage and a celebration of life, love, and
                        indulgence. The festival draws visitors from all over the world, who come to experience the vibrant parades, elaborate
                        costumes, and festive atmosphere. Whether you're a local or a visitor, Mardi Gras is a time to let loose and celebrate
                        with friends, family, and fellow revelers.

                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            Mardi Gras is known for its iconic colors of purple, green, and gold. These colors have a rich history and symbolism
                            that dates back to the earliest Mardi Gras celebrations in New Orleans.
                            <br><br>
                        
                            Purple represents justice, green represents faith, and gold represents power. These colors were chosen by the Krewe of
                            Rex, one of the oldest and most prestigious Mardi Gras organizations, in 1872. The krewe wanted to create a unique
                            identity for their parade, and the colors were chosen to represent the values of the festival.
                            <br><br>
                        
                            Over time, the colors of Mardi Gras became more widely adopted and are now an important part of the festival's
                            traditions. The colors are seen on everything from the elaborate floats to the costumes and decorations. The tradition
                            of throwing beads and trinkets from the floats also incorporates the festival's signature colors.
                            <br><br>
                        
                            Today, the colors of Mardi Gras are a beloved symbol of the festival and are recognized around the world as a symbol of
                            celebration and joy. Whether you're donning a purple, green, or gold costume, or catching a handful of Mardi Gras beads,
                            the colors of the festival are a reminder to let loose and enjoy the festivities.
